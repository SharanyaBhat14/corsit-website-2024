          <p>
            ROBOEXPO is an annual event organized by the Robotics club of SIT
            CORSIT. The primary objective is to introduce the club and its
            activities to the newcomers by displaying the bots that the members
            have created over the year. The event showcases various bots such as
            Line Follower Robots (LFR), Roboracer, Gesture controlled bots,
            Bluetooth controlled bots, etc. The exhibition provides students
            with an opportunity to witness and understand the workings of these
            bots up close. It serves as an excellent platform for the Robotics
            club to attract new members who are interested in this field.

          <p>
            CORSIT offers free workshops on IoT, Arduino, cloud, and more,
            providing students with hands-on experience in building basic bots
            such as LFR, Bluetooth, and obstacle-avoiding bots. Participants
            learn to code and use different components to program the bot's
            brain. The club also conducts a paid workshop where a mentor guides
            students on emerging technologies with a mix of studio practice and
            lectures. The workshop aims to enhance practical skills and teach
            the theory and context behind the practice.
